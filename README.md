# Restaurant Page

Simple restaurant page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and bundled with Webpack. The details of each 'tab' are stored as in <code>src/tabs.js</code> and the website's main section is refreshed and populated with the current tab's content via <code>src/website.js</code>. For the menu page, the food items are returned as objects in <code>src/food.js</code> allowing for simple additions or removals.
